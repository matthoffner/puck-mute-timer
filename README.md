Watching live tv I want to mute the commercials, this is a good enough solution using a [puck-js](https://www.puck-js.com/). 

Thanks to [https://github.com/knolleary/puck-remote](puck-remote) for code to detect buttons with visual indication. 

## How to use

Connect as bluetooth device controlling media. Press button to toggle mute states:

* Once to mute/unmute
* Twice to mute 1 minute
* Thrice to mute 2 minutes
